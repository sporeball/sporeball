### hi there!
we are a [plural system of 3 headmates](https://sporeball.dev/pages/system_information) who love programming weird stuff. indie games and Eurorack are nice too!

stuff we're responsible for includes:
- [naz](https://github.com/sporeball/naz) - an esolang where every instruction is named by a number and a letter
- [victus](https://github.com/sporeball/victus) - a zero-dependency JavaScript game framework
- [ABCO-1](https://github.com/sporeball/ABCO-1) - a hardware implementation of the OISC [abcout](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Abcout), with additional tools
- **...and a lot more**, [all open-source](https://github.com/sporeball?tab=repositories)
