### hi, i'm [sporeball](https://sporeball.dev)!
i'm a 17-year-old idiot who loves programming weird stuff. indie games and Eurorack are nice too!

stuff i'm working on:
- [naz](https://github.com/sporeball/naz), an esolang where every command is named by a number and a letter
- [victus](https://github.com/sporeball/victus), a zero-dependency JavaScript game framework
- [vim](https://github.com/sporeball/vim), a game about capturing territory and trying not to go bankrupt
- [ntdl](https://github.com/sporeball/ntdl), a to-do list for your terminal
- [otto](https://github.com/sporeball/otto), to help you bring your brain back into the foreground
